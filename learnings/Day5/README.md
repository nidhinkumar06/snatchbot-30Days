To add the data which we get from the user as an input to the Google Sheet we can do it in SnatchBot using the `Automation` option

There you could select the SnatchBot option and by clicking the select option you can configure the google sheet as well as the what value should be passed to an particular columns

Once the configuration is done we can test the action by filling the forms and once it is filled the values will be stored to the Google Sheet
